## Project Overview

Kidney disease is a critical medical condition that affects millions of people globally. Early diagnosis and prediction can significantly improve treatment outcomes. In this project, a machine learning model is built to predict kidney disease in patients based on various attributes, such as age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin levels, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and other medical features.

We applied multiple machine learning algorithms to this problem, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, with a focus on achieving the highest possible accuracy.

This repository demonstrates the full pipeline of the project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, followed by insights from the results.

## Dataset


The dataset used for training and testing the models is publicly available and can be accessed from the following link:

- [Kidney Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshayksingh/kidney-disease-dataset)


The dataset contains various attributes for each patient, including:

- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Specific Gravity
- Albumin levels
- Red Blood Cell Count
- White Blood Cell Count
- Serum Creatinine
- And other important medical features

These features are essential in diagnosing kidney disease, and the goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of kidney disease based on these parameters.

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: We handled missing values in the dataset by using imputation techniques. Numerical columns were filled with the median, while categorical columns were imputed using the mode of the column.
   - **Data Transformation**: Some features were transformed to a more meaningful format for the models. For example, categorical data was converted into numerical representations using encoding techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

2. **Normalization and Scaling**:
   - We used Min-Max scaling to normalize numerical features to the same range, ensuring that no particular feature dominates the others during training.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Features with high correlation were identified and removed to avoid multicollinearity. Feature importance from tree-based models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting was also used to select the most significant features.

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - The dataset was divided into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split to ensure the models were trained on a large portion of the data, while also testing their performance on unseen data.

5. **Handling Class Imbalance**:
   - Class imbalance was handled using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, improving model performance on underrepresented classes.

## Models and Results

Various models were tested to predict kidney disease. Below are the performance results of each model:

| Model                        | Accuracy Score |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Random Forest Classifier**  | 0.991667       |
| **Gradient Boosting**         | 0.975000       |
| **Logistic Regression**       | 0.908333       |
| **Decision Tree Classifier**  | 0.891667       |
| **KNN**                       | 0.741667       |
| **SVM**                       | 0.708333       |
| **XGBoost**                   | 0.600000       |

- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy score of **99.17%**. It was able to effectively capture complex patterns in the data.
- **Gradient Boosting** also performed well with an accuracy of **97.5%**, which is a strong competitor to Random Forest.
- **Logistic Regression**, a simpler model, showed **90.83%** accuracy, indicating that even basic models can give decent results for this dataset.
- **Decision Tree Classifier** achieved a reasonable score of **89.17%**, but it is more prone to overfitting.
- **KNN**, **SVM**, and **XGBoost** showed relatively lower performance compared to tree-based models, with scores ranging from **60% to 74%**.

## Model Evaluation

In addition to accuracy, we evaluated the models using several metrics:

1. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - We computed confusion matrices for each model to analyze the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

2. **ROC-AUC**:
   - The ROC curve and AUC score were used to assess the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for each model. A higher AUC value indicates better model performance.

3. **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**:
   - These metrics were used to assess the model's ability to correctly identify positive (kidney disease) and negative (no kidney disease) cases.

## Future Work

There are several areas where this project could be further improved:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization to tune the models for even better performance.

2. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Implement k-fold cross-validation to further evaluate model robustness and ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data.

3. **Advanced Feature Engineering**:
   - Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques, such as using domain-specific knowledge to create new features, or leveraging external data sources to improve predictions.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best-performing model as a web application using Flask or Django, where users can input their medical parameters and get a prediction about their kidney disease status.

5. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - Explore deep learning models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for possibly higher performance on this classification problem.

6. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - Further investigate and experiment with techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, or Ensemble methods to handle class imbalance more effectively.

## Conclusion

In this project, machine learning techniques were successfully applied to predict kidney disease based on various medical parameters. The best model, **Random Forest Classifier**, achieved an accuracy of **99.17%**, which demonstrates the power of ensemble methods in medical diagnosis. The models demonstrated good performance, but there is always room for improvement, especially in the areas of feature engineering and model optimization.

By continuing to explore new techniques and incorporating domain knowledge, we can further enhance the model's performance and deploy it in real-world applications to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.
